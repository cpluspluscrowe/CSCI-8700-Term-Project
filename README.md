# CSCI-8700-Term-Project
Term Project for CSCI 8700 with Dr. Harvey Siy
Okay, we need our final team formation and some preliminary project ideas.  Feel free to list your ideas below under PROJECT IDEAS.

PROJECT IDEAS
1.Online Music Store where customers can buy/upload music
2.Software license manager to better track software subscriptions (what one has/when it needs to be updated/costs)
3.Software that analyzes resumes and finds the best potential employee for different jobs (machine learning)
4.App that creates test study sheets from notes
5.Plagarism detection software for literature reviews
6.App that shows positive/negative news about companies to predict changes in stock prices

GUIDLINES FOR PART 1

Write a project proposal - the project can be any software application which benefits society
Define the context of the problem.
Define the overall system goals and scenarios.
Divide up the project into user stories and create a high level architecture. For each user story: refine into functional, object and dynamic models.
These models form the main body of the specification. The complete specification will use this format.
Create the prototypes: for each user story, develop a set of screen mockups.
Create a quick-and-dirty implementation of a subset of the user stories (to be specified by instructor) to prove that it is realizable.
Develop a set of acceptance tests for determining if the implementation conforms with the specification
